# GitHub Codespaces

This repository is nothing more than a newly create jekyll static web site.

It is a good exmaple of how to use GitHub codespaces to collaborate on the same project through native VS Code and Codespaces, with the use of Live Share for real-time collaboration

It can also be used to show a web server connection from codespaces to local machine
